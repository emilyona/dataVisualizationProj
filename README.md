# INFO 3300 Data Visualization Project

## By Kylie Kurz, Emily Sine, Aida Sarinzhipova

This project was focused on analyzing the famous USA TV shows the Bachelor and the Bachelorette. Since the two key criticisms of the shows were the lack of diversity and the age of the contestants, our team was
interested in exploring the average age of contestants by category (all, final fours, and winners), the representation of monirites on the show, as well as when the mniorities get eliminated throughout every season.

Overall, we have prepared three sets of data visualizaiton showing the things we listed above. Each set had two graphs: one for the Bachelor female contestants, and the Bachelorette male contestants.
The datasets used for analysis were either taken from kaggle or manually created from the information publicly available in the wikipedia, wiki fandom, and reliable articles.

At the end, we have learned that both The Bachelor and The Bachelorette TV shows have
been dealing with a serious issue related to minority representation, as well as expedited
elimination of minorities over the years. It was also learned that the leading roles tend to choose
those falling into a younger category of contestants compared to the average age of people on
the show. Whie some data was missing on the first seasons of the show,our graphs have
revealed that the period of 2009-2013 had almost no contestant minorities, both female and
male. However, we saw that it has ultimately gotten better in the past few years, especially since
the Bachelor had many scandals and got sued for underrepresented minorities in 2013.
